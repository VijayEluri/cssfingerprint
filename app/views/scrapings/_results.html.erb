<h3>User similarity</h3>

<p>Note: This section is <b>very</b> experimental and performs poorly so far. It will hopefully be improved considerably soon.</p>

<% if !@current_user.release_name %>
<p style="color: red;">You chose not to release your name; that's fine. However, this means that you will also not be shown others' names in this user similarity list.</p>

<p>If you want to see them, please run the scraper again with the same code, but entering your name and checking the consent box to share. Please note that you are free to use a nickname;
 I ask just that it be something by which people who actually know you can identify you, and not so generic as to be mistaken for someone else.</p>

<p>Who the AI thinks you are, in order of probability (out of <%= User.count %> people total):
